Build the first working prototype with zero extra feature 

It should just work


Build the next prototype with 1 extra feature 

Build the next prototype with 1 extra feature with more reliability in software. 


After each prototype,  request input from the user.

To continue building 
Or to stop execution. 

At the first step, build a planner.

Show the user, what will be achieved in iterative steps.

Keep everything in a sandbox. 

All experiments are done offline. We only have access to models of different levles. Running locally.
