Valorant + AWS - Hackathon

What to Build

You are hired as a data scientist on a new VALORANT esports team and have been tasked by the team’s general manager to support the scouting and recruitment process.

Build a LLM-powered digital assistant with a chat interface using Amazon Bedrock’s native capabilities. Use this new technology to build teams and answer various questions about VALORANT esports players, leveraging provided data sources and demonstrating effective information retrieval and analysis.

LLM-Powered Digital Assistant Requirements

The digital assistant should be able to provide team compositions based on the following prompts, assign player roles, and justify the team effectiveness:

    Professional Team Submission: Build a team with pro players (VCT International) only

    Semi-Professional Team Submission: Build a team with semi-pro (VCT Challengers) players only

    VCT Game Changers Team Submission: Build a team with VCT Game Changers players only

    Mixed-Gender Team Submission: Build a team with at least 2 players from an underrepresented group (ex. Game Changers)

    Cross-Regional Team Submission: Build a team with players from 3+ regions
    Rising Star Team Submission: Build a team that includes at least two semi-professional players (VCT Challengers or VCT Game Changers)

For each team composition:

    Answer questions about player performance with specific agents (in-game playable characters)
    Assign roles to players on the team and explain their contribution
        Offensive vs. defensive roles
        Category of in-game playable character / agent (duelist, sentinel, controller, initiator)
        Assign a team IGL (team leader, primary strategist and shotcaller)
    Provide insights on team strategy and hypothesize team strengths and weaknesses

Prompts

Your digital assistant should be able to provide responses to all of the following prompts. The system should also provide its reasoning for each prompt in the results:

    Team Submission Prompts - Main Prompts

        Professional Team Submission: "Build a team using only players from VCT International. Assign roles to each player and explain why this composition would be effective in a competitive match."

        Semi-Professional Team Submission: "Build a team using only players from VCT Challengers. Assign roles to each player and explain why this composition would be effective in a competitive match."

        Game Changers Team Submission: "Build a team using only players from VCT Game Changers. Assign roles to each player and explain why this composition would be effective in a competitive match."

        Mixed-Gender Team Submission: "Build a team that includes at least two players from an underrepresented group, such as the Game Changers program. Define roles and discuss the advantages of this inclusive team structure."

            To be used for bonus prizing evaluation

        Cross-Regional Team Submission: "Build a team with players from at least three different regions. Assign each player a role and explain the benefits of this diverse composition."

            To be used for bonus prizing evaluation

        Rising Star Team Submission: "Build a team that includes at least two semi-professional players, such as from VCT Challengers or VCT Game Changers. Define roles and discuss details of how these players were chosen."

Finalists will receive additional follow-up prompts after the down selection process. Please ensure your digital assistant can elaborate on the team compositions and provide reasoning for questions such as "What recent performances or statistics justify the inclusion of *player name* in the team?"

Stage Two Judging information:

At least 10 projects, but no more than 25 projects will be selected to complete Finalist Testing from October 30, 2024 (1pm Pacific Time) to November 5, 2024 (1pm Pacific Time). During the Finalist Testing stage, we will send a few additional prompts for finalists to test.

Finalists may make minor adjustments to their models in response to the prompts, however, no major changes will be allowed. The modified project must remain substantively the same as the original project with the only modification being what we permit.
