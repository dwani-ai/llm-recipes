LLM Scene

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/xrdevrob/QuestCameraKit.git



    Open the ImageLLM scene.
    Make sure to create an API key and enter it in the OpenAI Manager prefab.
    Select your desired model and optionally give the LLM some instructions.
    Make sure your headset is connected to the internet (the faster the better).
    Build the scene and run the APK on your headset.
