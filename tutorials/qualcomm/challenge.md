 Edge AI Consumer Utility Application

Build a powerful, AI-driven utility app for everyday users‚Äîright at the edge.
In this track, you'll will develop a consumer-facing utility application that runs entirely on-device using the Snapdragon X Elite platform. The challenge is to harness the power of Edge AI to create a tool that is both useful and accessible to a broad audience‚Äîwithout relying on cloud connectivity.

üîç What We‚Äôre Looking For:

‚Ä¢ Consumer-Oriented: The app should appeal to a wide range of users and offer clear, everyday value.
‚Ä¢ Utility-Focused: It must help users accomplish a task‚Äîwhether it's organizing, creating, assisting, or enhancing their experience.
‚Ä¢ Edge AI-Powered: The core functionality should include a probabilistic AI component (e.g., computer vision, audio processing, or generative AI) that runs locally in a resource-constrained environment.
‚Ä¢ Cross-Platform: While the app targets Snapdragon X Elite, it should be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
‚Ä¢ Developer-Ready: Submissions should include a GitHub repository with setup and run instructions. A polished consumer UI is not required‚Äîfocus on functionality and innovation.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Flexibility:

‚Ä¢ Use any programming language or framework.
‚Ä¢ Combine multiple AI modalities (CV, audio, Gen AI) as needed.
‚Ä¢ No internet connection should be required for core functionality.

Qualcomm will directly ship the Copilot+ PC with the Snapdragon¬Æ X Elite (loaner devices) to selected participants and collect them at the conclusion of the hackathon.
