Minions - hybrid models for cost optimisation

https://ollama.com/blog/minions


    Minion: cloud model freely chats with a single local model with access to data, until the two reach a solution
        Achieves 30.4x reduction in remote costs, while maintaining 87% of cloud model performance
    MinionS: cloud model decomposes the task into bit-sized subtasks to be performed on chunks of the context. Small LLMs solve these tasks in parallel
        Achieves 5.7x reduction in remote costs, while maintaining 97.9% of cloud model performance
