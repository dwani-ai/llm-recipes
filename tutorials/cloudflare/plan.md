LLM Instructions

To serve API requests from your laptop using Cloudflare Tunnels, you’ll need to set up a secure connection between your local machine and Cloudflare’s network using the `cloudflared` daemon. This allows you to expose your locally running API to the internet without opening ports on your router or firewall. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

---

### Prerequisites
1. **Cloudflare Account**: Sign up for a Cloudflare account at [cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/) if you don’t already have one.
2. **Domain**: You need a domain managed by Cloudflare to create a public hostname for your API. If you don’t have one, you can test with a temporary URL via Cloudflare’s TryCloudflare service, but a custom domain is recommended for production.
3. **Local API**: Ensure your API is running locally (e.g., on `http://localhost:8080` or another port).
4. **Operating System**: This guide works for Windows, macOS, or Linux.

---

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Install `cloudflared`
`cloudflared` is the lightweight daemon that establishes the tunnel between your laptop and Cloudflare’s network.

- **Windows**:
  1. Download the `cloudflared` executable from the [Cloudflare downloads page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation/) or use the following command in PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-windows-amd64.exe -OutFile cloudflared.exe
     ```
  2. Move the executable to a directory in your PATH (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32`) or keep it in a known location.

- **macOS**:
  1. Install via Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install cloudflared
     ```
  2. Or download the binary:
     ```bash
     curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-darwin-amd64 -o cloudflared
     chmod +x cloudflared
     sudo mv cloudflared /usr/local/bin/
     ```

- **Linux**:
  1. Use a package manager or download the binary:
     ```bash
     curl -L https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64 -o cloudflared
     chmod +x cloudflared
     sudo mv cloudflared /usr/local/bin/
     ```
  2. For Debian/Ubuntu, you can also add Cloudflare’s repository:
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://pkg.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-main.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-main.gpg >/dev/null
     echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloudflare-main.gpg] https://pkg.cloudflare.com/cloudflared any main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudflared.list
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install cloudflared
     ```

- Verify installation:
  ```bash
  cloudflared --version
  ```

#### 2. Authenticate `cloudflared`
Authenticate your `cloudflared` client with your Cloudflare account to manage tunnels.

1. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   cloudflared login
   ```
2. This opens a browser window prompting you to log in to your Cloudflare account. Authorize `cloudflared` to access your account.
3. After authorization, a credentials file (e.g., `~/.cloudflared/cert.pem`) is created on your laptop.

#### 3. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel
You can create a tunnel either via the Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard or the command line. The dashboard is more user-friendly for beginners.

- **Using the Dashboard**:
  1. Log in to the [Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard](https://one.cloudflare.com/).
  2. Navigate to **Networks > Tunnels**.
  3. Click **Create a tunnel**, select **Cloudflared** as the connector type, and give your tunnel a name (e.g., `my-api-tunnel`).
  4. Save the tunnel. You’ll be provided with a command to run `cloudflared` on your laptop, which includes a token. Copy this command, which looks like:
     ```bash
     cloudflared tunnel --token <YOUR_TOKEN>
     ```
  5. Run the command in a terminal on your laptop to start the tunnel.

- **Using the CLI (Alternative)**:
  1. Create a tunnel:
     ```bash
     cloudflared tunnel create my-api-tunnel
     ```
     This generates a tunnel ID and a credentials file (e.g., `~/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL-ID>.json`).
  2. Run the tunnel:
     ```bash
     cloudflared tunnel run my-api-tunnel
     ```

#### 4. Configure the Tunnel to Serve Your API
You need to map a public hostname to your local API service.

- **Using the Dashboard**:
  1. In the Zero Trust dashboard, go to **Networks > Tunnels**, select your tunnel, and click **Configure**.
  2. Under the **Public Hostname** tab, click **Add a public hostname**.
  3. Enter a subdomain (e.g., `api`) and select your domain from the dropdown (e.g., `example.com`).
  4. Specify the service your API is running on, e.g., `http://localhost:8080` (replace `8080` with your API’s port).
  5. Save the hostname. Your API will now be accessible at `https://api.example.com`.

- **Using a Configuration File (CLI)**:
  1. Create a configuration file at `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`:
     ```yaml
     tunnel: <TUNNEL-ID>
     credentials-file: ~/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL-ID>.json
     ingress:
       - hostname: api.example.com
         service: http://localhost:8080
       - service: http_status:404
     ```
  2. Run the tunnel with the configuration:
     ```bash
     cloudflared tunnel --config ~/.cloudflared/config.yml run
     ```

#### 5. Test the Tunnel
1. Open a browser or use a tool like `curl` to access your API at the public hostname (e.g., `https://api.example.com`).
   ```bash
   curl https://api.example.com
   ```
2. Ensure your local API server is running (e.g., `npm run dev` or equivalent for your framework).
3. Verify that requests are reaching your local API and responses are returned.

#### 6. Secure Your API (Optional but Recommended)
- **Cloudflare Access**: Add Zero Trust security to restrict access to your API.
  1. In the Zero Trust dashboard, go to **Access > Applications**.
  2. Click **Add an Application**, select **Self-hosted**, and choose your tunnel’s public hostname (e.g., `api.example.com`).
  3. Configure policies to allow specific users (e.g., via email, SSO, or IP ranges).
- **Firewall Configuration**: Ensure your laptop’s firewall allows outbound connections on port 7844 (TCP/UDP) for `cloudflared`. Block all inbound traffic to your API port (e.g., 8080) to ensure only Cloudflare can access it.[](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/tunnel-with-firewall/)
- **TLS**: Cloudflare automatically provides HTTPS for your public hostname, even if your local API uses HTTP.

#### 7. Run `cloudflared` as a Service (Optional)
To keep the tunnel running persistently:
- **Linux/macOS**:
  ```bash
  sudo cloudflared service install --token <YOUR_TOKEN>
  ```
- **Windows**:
  ```powershell
  .\cloudflared.exe service install --token <YOUR_TOKEN>
  ```

This installs `cloudflared` as a system service, ensuring it runs automatically on startup.

#### 8. TryCloudflare for Testing (No Domain Required)
If you don’t have a domain or want to test quickly:
1. Run a quick tunnel:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8080
   ```
2. `cloudflared` will output a temporary URL (e.g., `https://random-subdomain.trycloudflare.com`). Use this to access your API. Note that quick tunnels have a 200 concurrent request limit and don’t support Server-Sent Events (SSE).[](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/)

---

### Security Considerations
- **Traffic Visibility**: Cloudflare can see unencrypted traffic unless you enable end-to-end encryption (e.g., by running your API over HTTPS locally).[](https://programmingpercy.tech/blog/free-secure-self-hosting-using-cloudflare-tunnels/)
- **Access Control**: Use Cloudflare Access to restrict who can access your API.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/17dn991/security_concerns_exposing_my_local_restful_api/)
- **Firewall**: Block all inbound traffic to your API port (e.g., 8080) on your laptop and allow only outbound connections from `cloudflared` to Cloudflare’s network (port 7844).[](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/tunnel-with-firewall/)
- **API Security**: If your API requires authentication (e.g., API keys), ensure it’s implemented securely to prevent unauthorized access.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/17dn991/security_concerns_exposing_my_local_restful_api/)

---

### Troubleshooting
- **Connection Issues**: Ensure `cloudflared` is running and your local API is accessible at the specified address (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`). Check firewall settings to allow outbound traffic on port 7844.[](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/tunnel-with-firewall/)
- **Tunnel Not Found**: Verify the tunnel ID and credentials file exist in `~/.cloudflared/`.
- **DNS Issues**: Ensure your domain’s DNS is managed by Cloudflare and the CNAME for your tunnel (e.g., `<TUNNEL-ID>.cfargotunnel.com`) is correctly set up.[](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/faq/cloudflare-tunnels-faq/)
- **Logs**: Run `cloudflared` with `--loglevel debug` to get detailed logs for debugging:
  ```bash
  cloudflared tunnel --loglevel debug run my-api-tunnel
  ```

---

### Example
Suppose your API is running on `http://localhost:3000`. After setting up the tunnel and configuring a public hostname `api.example.com`, you can access it via:
```bash
curl https://api.example.com
```
The request will route through Cloudflare’s network, securely reaching your laptop’s API without exposing your local IP or opening ports.

---

### Additional Notes
- **Performance**: Cloudflare Tunnels are lightweight and can run on a laptop with minimal resources (e.g., 4GB RAM, 4 CPU cores recommended).[](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/configure-tunnels/tunnel-availability/system-requirements/)
- **Scaling**: For high traffic, consider running multiple `cloudflared` instances or upgrading to a paid Cloudflare plan for higher quotas.
- **Alternatives**: Tools like Ngrok or Tailscale can also expose local APIs, but Cloudflare Tunnels offer better integration with Cloudflare’s security features and global network.[](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/preview-with-cloudflare-tunnel/)
