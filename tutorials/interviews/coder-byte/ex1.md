Given two strings: a long one called N and a short one called K (made of lowercase letters), find the shortest slice of N that includes every unique letter from K at least once. Return that slice.Examples (simplified):  N = "ahffaksfajeeubsne", K = "jefaa" → shortest slice: "aksfaje" (has a, j, e, f, s? Wait, no—actually a, f, j, e, s? But output is aksfaje which covers j,e,f,a,a).  
N = "aaffhkksemckelloe", K = "fhea" → shortest slice: "affhkkse" (covers f,h,e,a).



def StringChallenge(strArr):
    N = strArr[0]
    K = strArr[1]
    required = {}
    for c in K:
        required[c] = required.get(c, 0) + 1
    total_unique = len(required)
    left = 0
    matched = 0
    current = {}
    min_len = float('inf')
    min_start = -1
    for right in range(len(N)):
        c = N[right]
        current[c] = current.get(c, 0) + 1
        if c in required and current[c] >= required[c]:
            matched += 1
        while left <= right and matched == total_unique:
            current_len = right - left + 1
            if current_len < min_len:
                min_len = current_len
                min_start = left
            d = N[left]
            current[d] -= 1
            if d in required and current[d] < required[d]:
                matched -= 1
            left += 1
    return N[min_start:min_start + min_len]

The problem is: You get a string made only of the letters "a", "b", and "c". Keep doing this until you can't anymore: If two letters next to each other are different, replace those two with the missing letter (like "a" + "b" becomes "c", "a" + "c" becomes "b", or "b" + "c" becomes "a"). Same letters can't be changed. At the end, return how long the final string is.Examples:"abcabc" ends up as length 2.
"cccc" stays the same, so length 4.

You have a list of strings, each like "(child,parent)" showing how nodes connect in a tree (child points to its parent). Check if these connections make exactly one valid binary tree: one root, no cycles, every node connected, and no parent has more than 2 kids. All numbers are unique. Return "true" if yes, "false" if not.



def ArrayChallenge(strArr):
    parent_of = {}
    children_map = {}  # parent -> list of children
    all_nodes = set()
    for s in strArr:
        s = s.strip('()')
        child, par = map(int, s.split(','))
        all_nodes.add(child)
        all_nodes.add(par)
        if child in parent_of:
            return "false"
        parent_of[child] = par
        if par not in children_map:
            children_map[par] = []
        children_map[par].append(child)
    # Check binary tree constraint
    for childs in children_map.values():
        if len(childs) > 2:
            return "false"
    # Find roots
    roots = all_nodes - set(parent_of.keys())
    if len(roots) != 1:
        return "false"
    root = list(roots)[0]
    # BFS to check connectivity and no cycles
    from collections import deque
    visited = set()
    q = deque([root])
    visited.add(root)
    while q:
        node = q.popleft()
        if node in children_map:
            for child in children_map[node]:
                if child in visited:
                    return "false"
                visited.add(child)

Simple Version of the ProblemGoal: Write a function called ArrayChallenge that takes a string (like "aa aa odg dog gdo") and counts how many pairs of different words in it are anagrams of each other.What’s an anagram? Two words made from the exact same letters, but rearranged (e.g., "dog" and "gdo" both use d, o, g).Key Rules:Split the string into words (separated by spaces).
Ignore exact duplicates of the same word (like two "aa"s don't count as an anagram pair).
Only count if the words are different but have the same letters.
Return the total number of such "extra" anagrams (e.g., in the example: "dog" and "gdo" are 2 extras for the "odg" group, so return 2).
Input: Only lowercase letters and spaces.

Example:
Input: "aa aa odg dog gdo"  "aa" appears twice: Ignore (same word).  
"odg", "dog", "gdo": These are 3 different rearrangements → 2 anagrams (total extras).
Output: 2
