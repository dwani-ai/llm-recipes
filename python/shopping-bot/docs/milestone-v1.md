## Milestone Document for Food Order Bot Project

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 22, 2025
**Prepared by:** Grok 3 (xAI)

---

### 1. Project Overview

The Food Order Bot is a conversational AI system built with FastAPI (backend), Gradio (frontend), and Mistral LLM for natural language processing. Users can log in, browse restaurant menus, place orders, and manage their orders via a chat interface. The project has evolved from a simple prototype to a robust, scalable system with persistent storage, configuration management, and LLM-driven tool calls.

This document outlines the milestones achieved, changes implemented, and features added, along with future milestones planned for production readiness.

---

### 3. Current State (February 22, 2025)

The Food Order Bot supports login, menu browsing, ordering, order management, multi-city queries, and price filtering via LLM tool calls.

**Known Issues:**
- Gradio Chatbot formatting issue with `\n` (displays as text instead of line breaks).

**Logs and SQLite storage ensure data persistence and debugging.**

---
