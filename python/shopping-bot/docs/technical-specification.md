# Technical Specification Document for Food Order Bot

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 22, 2025
**Prepared by:** Grok 3 (xAI)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Technical Specification Document (TSD) provides a detailed technical blueprint for the Food Order Bot, a conversational AI system for food ordering. It defines the software architecture, technology stack, components, interfaces, requirements, and acceptance criteria to guide development, ensure consistency, and verify completion.

### 1.2 Scope

The Food Order Bot enables users to interact via a chat interface (Gradio) to log in, browse restaurant menus, place orders, manage orders, and query multi-city availability and price constraints using a Mistral LLM. The system targets small to medium-sized food delivery startups, aiming for scalability, reliability, and user satisfaction.

## 2. Software Architecture and Tech Stack

### 2.1 Architecture Overview

The Food Order Bot follows a microservices-inspired architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend (Client):** Gradio-based web interface for user interaction.
- **Backend (API Server):** FastAPI-based server for business logic and API endpoints.
- **LLM Integration:** Mistral LLM for natural language processing and tool calls.
- **Persistence Layer:** SQLite for storing orders and sessions.
- **Configuration and Utilities:** Centralized configuration and logging for maintainability.

#### 2.1.1 Components

- **Gradio Client (`gradio_client.py`):**
  - Handles user input (text/voice) and displays responses in a chat interface.
  - Communicates with the backend via HTTP/REST APIs.

- **FastAPI Server (`mock_server.py`):**
  - Exposes endpoints for login, menu retrieval, orders, and query processing.
  - Integrates with `order_processor.py` for business logic.

- **Order Processor (`order_processor.py`):**
  - Executes LLM tool calls, manages order logic, and interacts with the database.

- **LLM Module (`llm.py`):**
  - Processes natural language inputs using Mistral, invoking tool calls for backend actions.

- **Database (`db.py`):**
  - Manages SQLite storage for sessions and orders.

- **Configuration (`config.py`):**
  - Loads settings from `.env` for flexibility.

- **Logging (`logging_config.py`):**
  - Provides structured logging to `food_order_bot.log`.

- **Models (`models.py`):**
  - Defines Pydantic models for request/response validation.

#### 2.1.2 Interfaces

- **Gradio ↔ FastAPI:** HTTP/REST API calls (e.g., POST `/process_order`, GET `/menu`).
  - Format: JSON (e.g., `{ "session_id": "uuid", "user_input": "login user1 password123" }`).

- **FastAPI ↔ LLM:** Internal function calls to `llm.process_with_tools` for tool call generation.
  - Format: LLM response with tool calls (e.g., `{"tool_calls": [{"name": "login", "arguments": {"username": "user1", "password": "password123"}}]}`).

- **FastAPI ↔ Database:** SQLite queries via `db.py` for CRUD operations.
  - Format: Python dictionaries or lists (e.g., `{"order_id": "uuid", "user_id": "user1", "items": [...]`).

- **FastAPI ↔ Mistral API:** HTTP/REST calls to Mistral API for LLM processing.
  - Format: JSON requests/responses as per Mistral’s `/v1/chat/completions` (e.g., `{"model": "mistral-large-latest", "messages": [...], "tools": [...]`).

### 2.2 Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI for backend, Gradio for frontend.
- **LLM:** Mistral API (via mistralai SDK, version 1.0.0+).
- **Database:** SQLite (via sqlite3).
- **HTTP Clients:** `httpx` for async HTTP requests, `requests` for sync calls.
- **Testing:** `pytest` for unit and integration tests.
- **Code Quality:** `flake8` for linting, `black` for formatting.
- **Logging:** Custom logging with logging module.
- **Configuration:** `python-decouple` or custom `config.py` with `.env`.
- **Version Control:** Git.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements (Derived from High-Level Product Specification)

The high-level product specification likely includes a scalable, user-friendly food ordering system with LLM-driven natural language processing. Based on this, the functional requirements are:

- **User Authentication:**
  - Users can log in with a username and password (e.g., `login user1 password123`).
  - System generates and manages JWT tokens for authenticated sessions.

- **Menu Browsing:**
  - Users can view restaurant menus by city (default: Bengaluru) via `menu` or `list restaurants in <city>`.
  - Supports multi-city queries (e.g., New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix).

- **Order Management:**
  - Users can place orders (e.g., `1 butter idli, add 2 ghee paddu from Rameshwaram Cafe`).
  - Supports order modification (e.g., `remove butter idli`), review (`review order`), confirmation (`confirm`), and cancellation (`cancel`).
  - Handles price constraints (e.g., `order items with price less than 300 Rs`).

- **Natural Language Processing:**
  - LLM processes natural language inputs via tool calls, mapping to backend functions/APIs (e.g., `login`, `add_to_order`).
  - Supports complex queries (e.g., city filtering, price filtering).

- **Order Persistence:**
  - Orders and sessions persist in SQLite, retrievable via `/orders/{order_id}` and `/orders/history` (future milestone).

- **Multi-City Support:**
  - Lists cities (`which cities are available?`) and filters restaurants by city.
  - Defaults to Bengaluru unless specified.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
  - Handle 1,000 concurrent users with an average response time < 2 seconds per request.
  - Implement rate limiting (100 requests/hour/user) to prevent abuse.

- **Scalability:**
  - Support horizontal scaling via cloud deployment (e.g., AWS/GCP) with Docker.
  - Use SQLite for prototyping, with plans for PostgreSQL or MongoDB in production.

- **Reliability:**
  - Achieve 99.9% uptime in production, with error logging and recovery mechanisms.
  - Handle LLM API outages gracefully with fallback responses.

- **Security:**
  - Use JWT for authentication, stored securely in sessions.
  - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords) and log only non-sensitive information.

- **Usability:**
  - Provide an intuitive Gradio interface with clear responses and no formatting issues (e.g., `\n` rendering).
  - Support voice input for accessibility.

- **Maintainability:**
  - Adhere to PEP 8 with `flake8` and `black` for code quality.
  - Use modular design with clear documentation and version control (Git).

- **Testing:**
  - Achieve 80% test coverage with `pytest` for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
  - Conduct weekly integration tests and final user testing before launch.

## 4. Definition of Done (DoD)

A feature or milestone is considered "Done" when:

- **Code Complete:**
  - All code is written, reviewed, and merged into the main branch.
  - Code passes `flake8` linting and `black` formatting checks.

- **Testing Complete:**
  - Unit tests cover 80% of new code, and integration tests verify functionality.
  - End-to-end tests confirm user flows (e.g., login → order → confirm) work as expected.

- **Documentation Updated:**
  - Technical specification, milestone document, and inline code comments are updated.
  - API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) is generated and reviewed.

- **Deployment Ready:**
  - Code is deployable to a staging environment with Docker.
  - CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) runs successfully, including linting, testing, and build.

- **Stakeholder Approval:**
  - Demonstrated to the engineering team and stakeholders, with feedback incorporated.
  - Meets acceptance criteria (see below).

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

A feature or milestone is accepted when:

- **Functional Requirements Met:**
  - Users can log in, browse menus, place orders, and manage them via natural language inputs.
  - Multi-city and price-filtering queries work correctly (e.g., list restaurants in New York, order items < 300 Rs).
  - LLM tool calls trigger the correct backend functions/APIs (e.g., login → `/login`, add_to_order → `/process_order`).

- **Non-Functional Requirements Met:**
  - Response time < 2 seconds for 95% of requests under 1,000 concurrent users.
  - Rate limiting prevents abuse (100 requests/hour/user).
  - System uptime > 99.9% in staging, with logged errors handled gracefully.
  - Gradio interface is intuitive, with no formatting issues (e.g., `\n` renders as line breaks).
  - Security measures (JWT, encryption) are verified by penetration testing.

- **Testing Verified:**
  - All tests pass (unit, integration, end-to-end) with 80% coverage.
  - No critical bugs reported during final user testing.

- **Documentation Verified:**
  - Technical specification, milestone document, and API docs are clear and complete.
