Assignment

AI Agent Assignment

Duration: 4-6 hours

Stack: Python
Overview

Create a simple conversational AI agent that solves the following problem. FoodieSpot, a growing restaurant chain with multiple locations across the city, is looking to streamline their reservation management process by implementing a chatbot solution for their customers. Please:

    Carefully design this solution - use this template to get started 
    Build an end to end agent that solves the problem. (Use streamlit or some other frontend).
    Minimum have 20-50 restaurant locations with different seating arrangements, cuisines.
    The agent should be able to help the user decide on a restaurant as well.
    Must use llama-3.1-8b (can use any api you want)
    The Solution must use tool calling - i.e. the LLM must decide the intent. Do not hardcode intent from the user input. 

    Refer to this article that explains what tool calling is https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/chat/function_calling/

This assignment tests your ability to work with LLMs, implement API integrations, and handle conversational flows. Do not use langchain or any other such library to build the agent. Build it from scratch. Feel free to use AI in building this solution.
