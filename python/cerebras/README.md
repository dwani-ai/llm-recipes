## Overview

The Military Decision Agent System is an advanced AI-powered platform designed to assist in military decision-making processes. It leverages cutting-edge natural language processing, computer vision, and audio analysis technologies to process multimodal inputs and provide comprehensive situation assessments and decision recommendations.

## Features

- **Multimodal Input Processing**: Analyzes video feeds, audio intercepts, and textual reports.
- **Integrated Decision Pipeline**: Implements a six-stage decision-making process:
  1. Perception
  2. Integration
  3. Situation Assessment
  4. Course of Action Generation
  5. Ethical Evaluation
  6. Final Decision Formulation
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning models for data processing.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Incorporates ethical guidelines into the decision-making process.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle complex military scenarios efficiently.

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.9+
- LangChain for AI agent orchestration
- OpenAI's GPT models for natural language processing
- TensorFlow and OpenCV for video analysis
- AssemblyAI for audio transcription
- Pydantic for data validation and settings management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/military-decision-agent.git
   cd military-decision-agent
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your_assemblyai_api_key
   SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_api_key
   ```

## Usage

To run the Military Decision Agent System:

```
python main.py
```

This will start the system and prompt for input data. Ensure you have the necessary video, audio, and text files ready for analysis.

## Configuration

The system's behavior can be customized through the `config.py` file. Key configurations include:

- LLM model selection
- Tool configurations for video and audio analysis
- Ethical guidelines
- Logging settings
