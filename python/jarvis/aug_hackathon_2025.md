ðŸ§© Challenge Descriptions


#1 Challenge: Hacking public transportation in city Neumarkt Its helpful to understand current statistic about public transportation in Germany: So you may check fact and figures: https://www.vdv.de/daten-fakten.aspx And also a report summary about the framework: https://www.agora-verkehrswende.de/fileadmin/Projekte/2023/Mobilitaetsgarantie_Teil-1/102_Mobilitaetsgarantie.pdf It will be a advantage if you investigate about required technology/methods, that can combine data about the population, the transportation offerings and statistic data (ages, salaries, count of housings in certain areas, ...)

#2 Challenge: Hacking the customer touch point with hardware equipment. Technical hardware requires very good UX and of course proper explanation how to use it. So it's good to already know what UX means and how important it is. For this challenge it's useful to have strong and reliable translation technology/methods. Same applies for a extraction technology/methods a lot of PDF files will be there as a basis.

#3 Challenge: Hacking know-how and solution management. Documenting solutions developed and mistakes is essential for a company's success. Hence firstly a proper framework must be established and secondly a well understandable, accessible and structured source of know-how/experiences. Recommendation here is to do some basic research about 'Knowledge Management'. It would be good that you already have ideas how to give guidance to employee having task/challenge based on already established processes/workflow/solutions applied.
