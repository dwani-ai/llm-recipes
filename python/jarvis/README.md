Jarvis - XR Hack 2025

- Aug 17-19 : Cologne

### **Best Use of AI with PCA by Meta**

Innovative experiences that combine the power of AI with Passthrough Camera Access to create dynamic, responsive, and intelligent interactions in MR environments.

### Challenge Categories

The categories are quite open, just make sure to keep in mind how the Jury votes, and that you need to fulfil the Project and Submission requirements below to be eligible. 

### Inspiration

- Go further than image caption, with real time object detection - how can you react to the real world that wasn‚Äôt possible before? 

- Take a multi-modal approach by processing various aspects of the user‚Äôs environment.

- Common context-aware capabilities include: 
  - Object Recognition, Tracking, Segmentation
  - QR Code Detection
  - Face and Pose Detection
  - Color-based tracking

- Keep in mind
  - Make use of our pre-built and ready to use AI Kits to save time.
  - You can combine visual, audio, and behavioral inputs to go beyond a single capability and create richer, context-aware experiences.
  - Browse our Context-Aware Capabilities Directory to explore use cases and ideas for how to combine Meta‚Äôs Camera Access with real time, environment aware AI.

- Jury Criteria
  - Compelling Concept¬†
    - The experience is different from what's currently on Meta Horizon Store or previous hackathons and best exemplifies a successful standalone app. We're looking for concepts that have the potential to attract, engage, and retain a meaningful number of users on Quest.
  - Quality / Implementation 
    - The experience is well executed, with a quality user experience once the experience launches. The experience is polished and is performant on Meta Quest. The overall presentation of the project including the text description, slides, images, and video quality as stated in the submission requirements.
  - Category Specific Capabilities Criteria
    - Best Use of AI with PCA: The experience should meaningfully demonstrate the advantages of integrating Context-Aware AI with Passthrough Camera Access on Meta Quest, enabling intelligent applications that go beyond generic speech synthesis or generative AI.

- Project Requirements
  - Functionality: The Project must be capable of being successfully installed and running consistently on the platform for which it is intended and must function as depicted in the video and/or expressed in the text description.
  - New & Existing: Projects must be newly created by the Entrant and must not have been previously submitted to any other hackathon or published on the Meta Horizon Store/Horizon Worlds. Teams are welcome to ideate, brainstorm or create mockups before the hackathon, but no coding or implementation is allowed prior to the event.
Entrant may use publicly available toolkits or assets, as long as they are accessible to everyone
  - Third-Party Integrations: If a Project integrates any third-party SDK, APIs and/or data, the Entrant must be authorized to use them in accordance with any terms and conditions or licensing requirements of the tool. Sponsor and Administrator reserve the right to request proof of such authorization or licensure.
  - Category Specific Requirements:
  - **For Best Use of AI with PCA:** Build a context-aware, intelligent experience using PCA (Passthrough Camera Access) and at least one [Context-Aware AI](https://xrbootcamp.com/context-aware-ai-the-expanding-multi-modal-intelligence-of-smartglasses-and-xr) capability (e.g. Object Detection, Segmentation, Tracking, Audio Classification, Text Recognition, Face Detection, QR Code Detection). The project should go beyond basic capabilities like text or image generation, clearly demonstrating how PCA and AI/CV work together to create applications that understand and adapt to user's environment.

Submission Requirements

Each team member needs a Devpost account and has to join the XR Hack on Devpost. 

One member from each team has to submit the project making sure to tag all other team members as collaborators.

Include a Project built with the required developer tools and meets the above Project Requirements. We don‚Äôt expect your team to share the Git link or make it open-source. It‚Äôs completely ok to make your project commercial or store-ready.

iInclude an APK attachment with your project. 

Onclude a demonstration video of your Project (around one (1) minute, shows the experience as viewed on Quest, publicly visible, no third-party trademarks, no copyrighted music, etc.)

Include a text description that explains the features and functionality of your Project.

List paid software assets, third-party SDKs or APIs, and paid design tools in the project code and the project submission.

Create a folder inside the Google Drive. Name it after your team name and team number e.g. ‚Äú[S11] HackFace‚Äù for San Francisco Hack or ‚Äú[C11] HackFace‚Äù for Cologne Hack. 

For Mixed Reality and Best Use of AI with PCA: Upload the apk file and demo video. 

Upload all other files in a subfolder, name it ‚ÄúOther.‚Äù


A team may only submit one project.
