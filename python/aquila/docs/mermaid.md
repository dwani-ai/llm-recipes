## System Components

1. **Decision Agent System**: The central system that processes inputs and generates decisions.
2. **Multimodal Integration Engine**: Combines different types of input data (video, audio, text).
3. **Video/Audio/Text Processors**: Specialized components for processing each type of input.
4. **Decision-Making Core**: The heart of the system where analysis and decision generation occur.
5. **Situation Assessment**: Evaluates the current operational environment.
6. **Course of Action Generator**: Proposes potential actions based on the assessment.
7. **Action Evaluation**: Assesses proposed actions considering various factors.
8. **Ethical Guidelines Engine**: Ensures decisions align with ethical standards and rules of engagement.
9. **Knowledge Base**: Stores historical data and learned patterns to inform decision-making.

## External Interfaces

- **Military Personnel**: Primary users of the system.
- **Command and Control Systems**: Receive and act on the system's output.
- **External Intelligence Systems**: Provide additional input data.
- **Sensor Networks**: Supply real-time environmental and situational data.

This architecture enables the Military Decision Agent System to process complex, multimodal inputs and generate informed decisions while adhering to ethical guidelines and leveraging historical knowledge.
