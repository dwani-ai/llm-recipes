To create a C4 diagram for the military use case, we'll focus on the decision agent system that processes video, audio, and text inputs. We'll develop the diagram through the first three levels of the C4 model: System Context, Container, and Component.

## Level 1: System Context Diagram

[User] --> [Military Decision Agent System]
[Military Decision Agent System] --> [External Intelligence Systems]
[Military Decision Agent System] --> [Command and Control Systems]
[Sensor Networks] --> [Military Decision Agent System]

## Level 2: Container Diagram

Within the Military Decision Agent System:

[Video Input Processor] --> [Multimodal Integration Engine]
[Audio Input Processor] --> [Multimodal Integration Engine]
[Text Input Processor] --> [Multimodal Integration Engine]
[Multimodal Integration Engine] --> [Decision-Making Core]
[Decision-Making Core] --> [Output Interface]
[Knowledge Base] <--> [Decision-Making Core]

## Level 3: Component Diagram

Inside the Decision-Making Core container:

[Pattern Recognition Module] --> [Situation Assessment Module]
[Situation Assessment Module] --> [Course of Action Generator]
[Course of Action Generator] --> [Action Evaluation Module]
[Action Evaluation Module] --> [Decision Output Formatter]
[Ethical Guidelines Engine] --> [Action Evaluation Module]
[Machine Learning Models] <--> [Pattern Recognition Module]
[Machine Learning Models] <--> [Situation Assessment Module]

This C4 diagram provides a hierarchical view of the military decision agent system, showing its context within the larger military infrastructure, its main containers (subsystems), and the key components within the decision-making core[1][2][3]. The diagram helps visualize the flow of information from input processors through the integration engine to the decision-making core, and finally to the output interface[4].
