To create a Gantt chart and milestones for implementing the military decision agent system with a team of 4 members, I'll outline a high-level project plan based on the system components we discussed earlier. Here's a simplified Gantt chart representation:

## Project Timeline

| Task                                | Week 1-2 | Week 3-4 | Week 5-6 | Week 7-8 | Week 9-10 | Week 11-12 |
|-------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Project Initiation & Planning       | ████     |          |          |          |           |            |
| Input Processor Development         |          | ████████ | ████     |          |           |            |
| Multimodal Integration Engine       |          |          | ████     | ████     |           |            |
| Decision-Making Core Implementation |          |          |          | ████     | ████████  |            |
| System Integration & Testing        |          |          |          |          |           | ████████   |

## Key Milestones

1. Project Kickoff: End of Week 1
2. Input Processors Completed: End of Week 6
3. Integration Engine Functional: End of Week 8
4. Decision-Making Core Implemented: End of Week 10
5. System Integration Complete: Mid-Week 12
6. Project Delivery: End of Week 12

## Team Assignments

1. Team Lead: Oversees project, manages timeline, coordinates with stakeholders
2. AI/ML Specialist: Focuses on decision-making core and machine learning models
3. Systems Engineer: Develops multimodal integration engine and system architecture
4. Full-stack Developer: Implements input processors and assists with integration

This Gantt chart provides a high-level overview of the project timeline, key tasks, and milestones for implementing the military decision agent system. The team of 4 members can work collaboratively, with each focusing on their area of expertise while supporting others as needed[1][3][4].
