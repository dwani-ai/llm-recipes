## C4 Model for Military Decision Agent System

### Level 1: System Context Diagram

[Military Decision Agent System] - Processes multimodal inputs and provides decision recommendations
[Military Personnel] - Uses the system for decision support
[Video Feed System] - Provides video data
[Audio Intercept System] - Provides audio data
[Intelligence Database] - Provides textual reports and data

### Level 2: Container Diagram

[Web Application] - Provides user interface for input and output
[Decision Engine API] - Coordinates the decision-making process
[Video Analysis Service] - Processes video data
[Audio Analysis Service] - Processes audio data
[Text Analysis Service] - Processes textual data
[Data Integration Service] - Integrates multimodal data
[Ethical Evaluation Service] - Evaluates ethical considerations
[Database] - Stores system data and results

### Level 3: Component Diagram (for Decision Engine API)

[Input Processor] - Handles incoming data from various sources
[Perception Module] - Analyzes individual data types
[Integration Module] - Combines data from different sources
[Situation Assessment Module] - Evaluates the current situation
[Course of Action Generator] - Proposes potential actions
[Ethical Evaluator] - Assesses ethical implications
[Decision Formulator] - Produces final recommendations
[Output Formatter] - Prepares results for presentation

## Functional Requirements

1. Process video, audio, and text inputs
2. Perform multimodal data integration
3. Generate situation assessments
4. Propose courses of action
5. Evaluate ethical considerations
6. Formulate final decision recommendations
7. Present results in a clear, actionable format

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Security: Ensure data encryption and access control
2. Performance: Process inputs and generate recommendations within 5 minutes
3. Scalability: Handle up to 100 concurrent users
4. Reliability: Achieve 99.9% uptime
5. Compliance: Adhere to military data handling regulations
6. Usability: Intuitive interface for military personnel

## Definition of Done

1. All code is peer-reviewed and passes static analysis
2. Unit tests cover >80% of the codebase
3. Integration tests pass for all components
4. System tests validate end-to-end functionality
5. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
6. Performance benchmarks meet or exceed requirements
7. Security audit reveals no critical vulnerabilities
8. Ethical guidelines compliance is verified

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System accurately processes video, audio, and text inputs
2. Data integration produces coherent multimodal analysis
3. Situation assessments align with expert evaluations
4. Proposed courses of action are relevant and actionable
5. Ethical evaluations consider all predefined guidelines
6. Final recommendations are clear and justified
7. User interface is intuitive for military personnel
8. System responds to inputs within the specified time frame
9. Data security measures prevent unauthorized access
10. System scales to handle the required number of concurrent users

This architecture provides a comprehensive framework for the Military Decision Agent System, addressing both functional and non-functional requirements while ensuring clear criteria for completion and acceptance[^1][^3][^7].
