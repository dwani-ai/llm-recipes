To simulate Grok's image generation capability for a military agent, you can use the following prompt structure:

"Generate a [time of day] satellite image of [specific military location or scenario] showing [key elements]. Include [specific military assets or activities] with [level of detail]. Ensure [particular features or conditions] are visible. The image should convey [desired mood or tactical information]."

Example prompts:

1. "Generate a night-time satellite image of a coastal military base showing active defense systems. Include patrolling naval vessels and illuminated runways with high detail. Ensure radar installations and communication towers are visible. The image should convey a state of high alert."

3. "Generate a midday satellite image of an urban warfare scenario showing building-to-building combat. Include civilian structures, military checkpoints, and evidence of recent explosions with sharp clarity. Ensure sniper positions and evacuation routes are visible. The image should convey the complexity of urban tactical operations."
