# Improved Process for Creating Version 1 of the Audiobook

## 1. Define the Project Structure and Workflow
- Clearly define the project structure, including file organization, naming conventions, and workflow. This will help in maintaining consistency and ease of management.

## 2. Write Prompt for Analyzing Speech Text
- Write a prompt to analyze the speech text and update the speaker's voice based on emotions. This should be done early to understand the emotional context and tailor the voices accordingly.

## 3. Create Data Structure for Prompt and Speech Edits
- Develop a data structure to maintain changes in prompts and speech for editing software in UX. This will help in tracking and managing updates efficiently.

## 4. Write Prompt for Background Sound Decision
- Write a prompt for the parser to decide the duration and type of background sound to create. This should be based on the scene and the emotional context.

## 5. Generate Background Audio with 3s Clips
- Create background audio using 3s clips. Ensure that the background audio is cohesive and adds to the overall ambiance without overwhelming the speech.

## 6. Hard Code Generation for Each Speaker and Music
- Hard code the generation for each speaker and music. Ensure that the voices and music are consistent with the emotional context and scene.

## 7. Create Audio Files Per Event Scene with Order Maintained
- Generate audio files for each event scene while maintaining the order. This will help in creating a seamless narrative flow.

## 8. Combine All Media in Final Steps
- Combine all media elements (speech, background audio, music) in the final steps to create a cohesive audiobook. Ensure that all elements are synchronized and blend well together.
