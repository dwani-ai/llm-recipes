use case

NotebookLM can be replicated using Open weight models using python scripts from Notebookllama.

The value add is creating an UX for all user (non-programmer), who can bring audio books to life from all the books, notes, ideas that they have created .

I have been writing online journals for 5+ years, now building a simple project that can create audio books from the journals in 
podcast format for my own consumption. 
Helps to learn from past experience and find out what was missed and hidden over time.

Code is coming nicely for the scripts,
Next steps is designing a UX and making it available for others to experiment.
