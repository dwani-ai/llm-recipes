Booking Agent

AI Agent Challenge:Restaurant Reservation System

Duration: 4-6 hours
Stack: Python
Overview

GoodFoods, a growing restaurant chain with multiple locations across the city, is looking to streamline their reservation management process. This challenge asks you to both design and implement a conversational AI solution while demonstrating your business strategy thinking.
Challenge Components
Part 1: Solution Design & Business Strategy (40%)

    Create a comprehensive use case document using this template
    Identify key business problems and opportunities beyond the basic reservation system
    Define measurable success metrics and potential ROI for the client
    Map out potential for vertical expansion (e.g., how this solution could be adapted for other restaurant chains or adjacent industries)
    Identify 2-3 unique competitive advantages your approach would provide

Part 2: Technical Implementation (60%)

    Build an end-to-end reservation agent with a frontend (Streamlit or similar)
    Populate system with 50-100 restaurant locations with varying seating capacities, cuisines, etc.
    Implement recommendation capabilities to help users select appropriate venues
    Use llama-3.1-8b (or similar size small model, via any API you prefer)
    Implement proper tool calling architecture:

    LLM must determine intent rather than hardcoding based on user input
    Reference: Tool Calling Overview

    Build the agent from scratch (no LangChain or similar frameworks)

Evaluation Criteria

    Business Strategy (40%)

    Quality of use case documentation and vertical expansion thinking
    Identification of non-obvious business opportunities
    Clarity of success metrics, implementation timeline, key stake holders, potential customers, etc.
    Creativity in solution positioning

    Technical Execution (60%)

    Code quality and organization
    Prompt engineering and conversation design
    Tool calling implementation
    Error handling and edge cases
    User experience

Submission Guidelines

    Provide a private GitHub repository with your implementation 
    Include a professional README with:

    Setup instructions
    Documentation of your prompt engineering approach
    Example conversations showing different user journeys
    Business strategy summary

    Document any assumptions, limitations, or future enhancements

This challenge evaluates both your technical abilities and your business acumen - qualities essential for a GenAI Engineer who must bridge customer needs with technological solutions.
